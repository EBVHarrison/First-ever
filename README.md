# First-ever
starting CS50 psets
I am a middle school teacher in Georgia, hoping to learn more than I know about SCRATCH, Karel and HTML, to share with my students. 
This is already a challenge! 
Is GitHub available to me for use with them? 
I hope I have the time to complete CS50 before July 28! 
Summer evaporates. 
I take a GACE certification exam on August 3. 
WOW. 
Here we go.
